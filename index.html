                <h2>What is alternative or complementary medicine?</h2>
                <p>
                    Many patients choose to use treatments outside of conventional medicine. These may include traditional or herbal medicine developed from a variety of cultures such as traditional European or Chinese medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The terms "alternative" and "complementary" medicine are often used interchangably. However, there is a distinction — alternative medicine refers to treatments used in place of conventional medicine while complementary medicine encompasses treatments used alongside conventional practices. The same practices can be considered "alternative" or "complementary" based on whether or not they are used with conventional medical treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this blog, we will be looking into various forms of alternative and complementary practices from a scientific perspective and deciding — are these treatments effective and safe alternatives to conventional medicine? In particular, we will be looking into the practice of naturopathy.

                <h2>What is naturopathy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Naturopathy originates from traditional European medical practices popular during the 18<sup>th</sup> century. It focuses on the use of natural remedies to leverage the body's natural healing process. Naturopathic doctors are not medical doctors but do undergo 4 years of professional training in naturopathy and have experience in health-related sciences, nutrition, and phychology.

                <h3>Main principles of naturopathy</h3>
                <p>
                    The main principle of naturopathy is to aid in the body's natural healing process while avoiding treatments with adverse side effects. Naturopathy focuses on identifying and resolving underlying causes of diseases rather than simply relieving its symptoms. Compared to conventional medical doctors, naturopaths take a more hollistic and personal approach to health, emphasizing the health of the entire individual rather than that of a particular organ or system and educating patients on lifestyle choices to boost overall health and prevent future illness.

                <p>
                    Homeopathy developed in the 18th century by 1796 by German physician Samuel Hahnemann and became popular among European countries and eventually spread to North America. It is form of traditional medicine that follows the principle of "like cures like". Herbs that create similar symptoms in healthy people are said to stimulate natural healing and are administered in diluted quantities.
                </p>
                <h3>Dilution</h3>
                <p>
                    Homeopathy believes that the more diluted the medication, the greater its potency. However, this belief runs against scientific patterns, which predict that higher dosages should result in more pronounced effects. Active ingredients are often diluted in water or alcohol and run through the same dilution process several times. In fact, some homeopathic treatments are diluted enough to only contain several molecules of the original substance or even no active ingredient at all. Homeopathic potency levels are often written as <i>n</i>X or <i>n</i>C, representing a concentration level of 1/10<sup><i>n</i></sup> and 1/100<sup><i>n</i></sup>, respectively. For example, a potency level of 4C means a solution of 1 part of active ingredient per 100<sup>4</sup> = 100,000,000 parts of solution.
                </p>
                <h3>Effectiveness and Safety</h3>
                <p>
                    Homeopathy may be used in attempting to treat minor issues such as nausea or colds. However, there is little scientific evidence of its actual effectiveness, especially with the lack of active ingredient in its remedies. Positive effects of homeopathy can often be attributed to the placebo effect — in which the patient who uses the medication feels better due to the psychological effect comming from the belief that the treatment will work. The safety of homeopathic treatments can range, with some homeopathic medications containing contain harmless substances such as commonly consumed foods and otehrs containing potentially harmful substances such as toxic heavy metals.

                <h2>Herbalism</h2>
                <p>Naturopathy often encourages the use of herbs as treatment for illnesses and as dietary supplements. The following are examples of herbs used in naturopathy, their uses, and the scientific research around their effects:</p>
                <h3>Stinging Nettle</h3>
                <p>
                    Stinging nettle originates from the plant <i>Urtica dioica</i> and is consumed as extracts in herbal medicine. The raw version of the plant can cause skin irritation and is often used as a counterirritant to counteract pain. It is also said to be effective for treating infections, inflammation, allergic rhinitis, asthma, arthritis, high blood pressure, and diabetes. However, there are insufficient large-scale clinical trials to provide evidence decisive evidence of these effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stinging nettle has been theorized to have the following theraputic effects, although more research is required to confirm their efficacy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing the effects of <b>enlarged prostate</b> in men by blocking the synthesis of hormones such as dihydrotestosterone</li>
                    <li>Reducing the effects of <b>high blood pressure</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Produce vasolidators, which relax blood vessels</li>
                        <li>Produce calcium channel blockers, which reduce force of heart contractions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Reducing <b>blood sugar levels</b> with compounds that mimic insulin</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Stinging nettle may interact with other medications. For example, it can strengthen the effects of diuretics, which could result in dehydration.
                </p>
                <h3>St John’s Wort</h3>
                <p>
                    St. John's Wort has traditionally been used to treat depression. The active substance that achieves this effect is currently unknown — possible candidates include hypericin, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consumers should be catious when consuming St. John's Wort with other medications because it can alter the metabolism of pharmacutical drugs by influnecing drug transport proteins and enzymes. According to the National Library of Medicine, drug interactions involving this herb include those with birth control pills, transplant rejection agents, antiretroviral agents, digoxin, platelet inhibitors, and anticoagulants.
                </p>
                <h3>Oregano oil</h3>
                <p>
                    Oregano leaves and flowers are sometimes used as a spice. In herbal medicine, oregano oils have traditionally been used to treat respiratory diseases and parasitic infections. Like many herbal medications, the biologically active ingredient is not fully known and is suspected to be carvacrol or thymol. In living and artificial environments outside of the human body, oregano oils have demonstrated several beneficial properties, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Resistance to infections</b> through antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiparasitic effects</li>
                    <li>Antioxidant effects</li>
                    <li>Antineoplastic effects</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, oregano oils are not officially recognized treatment in modern medicine. They are generally considered safe, with side effects of higher doses such as abdominal discomfort, heartburn, constipation or diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Oregano oils should be avoided by pregnant women because it may result in miscarriage.

                <h3>What are free radicals?</h3>
                <p>
                    Free radicals are substances that can stably exist with unpaired electrons, many of which involve nitrogen and oxygen species. By lacking electrons, they are highly reactive and can alter lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. A simple example of a free radicals is nitrogen dioxide, shown below, where nitrogen has a single unpaired electron.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Free radicals are linked to increasing the risk of diseases such as cancers and heart disease. Free radicals are produced by the body through normal metabolism and can also result from the body's exposure to chemical carcinogens and radiation.
                </p>
                <h3>What are antioxidants?</h3>
                <p>
                    Antioxidants are substances that reduce the oxidative effects of free radicals by donating electrons, without becoming free radicals themselves. Examples of antioxidants include B-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, which are all substances that cannot be produced by the human body and must be consumed from food.
